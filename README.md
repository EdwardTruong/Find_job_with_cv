Hi there, If you see this GitHub account, it means there is an issue with my main account, but don't worry as the code is still being updated here, just a bit less frequently. I will soon update my main account and code on this account.

## Function
For email function :
 Go to 
 
     https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
 And : 
         
         Allow less secure apps : ON
  If the email account does not allow that feature, it needs to be changed to another email.

  ---> In the application.properties, I have an example email which has the email sending feature turned off. You can replace it with your email and follow the steps above to make the function work efficiently
